<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2501. Congressional findings and policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Nation's dependence on foreign sources of petroleum must be reduced, as such dependence jeopardizes national security, inhibits foreign policy, and undermines economic well-being;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Nation's balance of payments is threatened by the need to import oil for the production of liquid fuel for gasoline-powered vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the single largest use of petroleum supplies is in the field of transportation, for gasoline- and diesel-powered motor vehicles;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1838 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the expeditious introduction of electric and hybrid vehicles into the Nation's transportation fleet would substantially reduce such use and dependence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such introduction is practicable and would be advantageous because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) most urban driving consists of short trips, which are within the capability of electric and hybrid vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) much rural and agricultural driving of automobiles, tractors, and trucks is within the capability of such vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) electric and hybrid vehicles are more reliable and practical now than in the past because propulsion, control, and battery technologies have improved, and further significant improvements in such technologies are possible in the near term;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) electric and hybrid vehicles use little or no energy when stopped in traffic, in contrast to conventional automobiles and trucks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the power requirements of such vehicles could be satisfied by charging them during off-peak periods when existing electric generating plants are underutilized, thereby permitting more efficient use of existing generating capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) such vehicles do not emit any significant pollutants or noise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) it is environmentally desirable for transportation systems to be powered from central sources, because pollutants emitted from stationary sources (such as electric generating plants) are potentially easier to control than pollutants emitted from moving vehicles; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the introduction of electric and hybrid vehicles would be facilitated by the establishment of a Federal program of research, development, and demonstration to explore electric and hybrid vehicle technologies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is therefore declared to be the policy of the Congress in this chapter to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) encourage and support accelerated research into, and development of, electric and hybrid vehicle technologies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) demonstrate the economic and technological practicability of electric and hybrid vehicles for personal and commercial use in urban areas and for agricultural and personal use in rural areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) facilitate, and remove barriers to, the use of electric and hybrid vehicles in lieu of gasoline- and diesel-powered motor vehicles, where practicable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) promote the substitution of electric and hybrid vehicles for many gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles currently used in routine short-haul, low-load applications, where such substitution would be beneficial.</p>

The data so developed shall serve as baseline data to be utilized in order (1) to compare improvements in electric and hybrid vehicle technologies; (2) to assist in establishing the performance standards under subsection (b)(1); and (3) to otherwise assist in carrying out the purposes of this section. In developing any such data, the Secretary of Energy shall purchase or lease a reasonable number of such vehicles or enter into such other arrangements as the Secretary of Energy deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Performance standards; factors considered; vehicle uses; revision; transmission of standards to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 15 months after September 17, 1976, the Secretary of Energy shall promulgate rules establishing performance standards for electric and hybrid vehicles to be purchased or leased pursuant to subsection (c)(1). The standards so developed shall take into account the factors of energy conservation, urban traffic characteristics, patterns of use for &quot;second&quot; vehicles, consumer preferences, maintenance needs, battery recharging characteristics, agricultural requirements, materials demand and their ability to be recycled, vehicle safety and insurability, cost, and other relevant considerations, as such factors and considerations particularly apply to or affect vehicles with electric or hybrid propulsion systems. Such standards are to be developed taking into account (A) the best current state-of-the-art, and (B) reasonable estimates as to the future state-of-the-art, based on projections of results from the research and development conducted under section 2505 of this title. In developing such standards, the Secretary of Energy shall consult with appropriate experts concerning design needs for electric and hybrid vehicles which are compatible with long-range urban planning, traffic management, and vehicle safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Separate performance standards shall be established under subsection (b)(1) with respect to (A) electric or hybrid vehicles for personal use, and (B) commercial electric or hybrid vehicles. Such performance standards shall represent the minimum level of performance which is required with respect to any vehicles purchased or leased pursuant to subsection (c). Initial performance standards under subsection (b)(1) shall be set at such levels as the Secretary of Energy determines are necessary to promote the acquisition and use of such vehicles for transportation purposes which are within the capability (as determined by the Secretary of Energy) of electric and hybrid vehicles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Such performance standards shall be revised, by rule, periodically as the state-of-the-art improves.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Energy shall transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, and to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate, the performance standards developed under paragraph (1) and all revised performance standards established in connection with the demonstrations specified in subsection (c)(2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of Energy shall, within 6 months after the date of promulgation of performance standards pursuant to subsection (b)(1), institute the first contracts for the purchase or lease of electric or hybrid vehicles which satisfy the performance standards set forth under subsection (b)(1). The delivery of such vehicles shall be completed according to the expedited best effort of the administering agency and the selected manufacturer. To the extent practicable, vehicles purchased or leased under such contracts shall represent a cross-section of the available technologies and of actual or potential vehicle use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Thereafter, according to a planned schedule, the Secretary of Energy shall contract for the purchase or lease of additional electric or hybrid vehicles which satisfy amended performance standards and represent continuing improvements in state-of-the-art. In conducting demonstrations, the Secretary of Energy shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the need and intent of the Congress to stimulate and encourage private sector pro<!-- PDFPage:1841 -->duction as well as public knowledge, acceptance, and use of electric and hybrid vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) demonstration of varying degrees of vehicle operations, management, and control for maximum widespread effectiveness and exposure to public use.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The demonstration period shall extend through the fiscal year 1986, with purchase or leasing continuing through the fiscal year 1984. During the demonstration period the Secretary of Energy shall demonstrate 7,500 to 10,000 electric and hybrid vehicles. No more than 400 vehicles may be procured for this purpose during fiscal year 1978. In order to allow industry time for advanced planning, the size and nature of projected electric and hybrid vehicle leasing and procurements will be made public by the administering agency. Publications under the preceding sentence (each covering a period of two years) shall be released annually starting at an appropriate time in the fiscal year 1978.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Arrangements for the demonstration of vehicles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy, in supervising the demonstration of vehicles acquired under subsection (c), shall make such arrangements as may be necessary or appropriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) to make such vehicles available to Federal agencies and to State or local governments and other persons for individual or business use (including farms). The individuals and businesses involved shall be selected by an equitable process which assures that the Secretary of Energy will receive accurate and adequate data on vehicle performance, including representative geographical and climatological information and data on user reaction to the utilization of electric and hybrid vehicles. Such individuals and businesses shall be given the option of purchasing or leasing such vehicles under terms and conditions which will promote their widespread use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to pay the differential operating costs of such vehicles to the extent necessary to assure the adequate demonstration of such vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for demonstration maintenance projects, including maintenance organization and equipment needs and model training projects for maintenance procedures; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for the dissemination of data on electric and hybrid vehicle safety and operating characteristics (including nontechnical descriptive data which shall be made available by the Government Publishing Office) (A) to Federal, State, and local consumer affairs agencies and groups; (B) to Federal, State, and local agricultural and rural agencies and groups; and (C) to the public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Displacement of private procurement; reports to congressional committees; reduction of number purchased</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) At least 60 days prior to entering into any contract for the purchase or lease of any electric or hybrid vehicle under subsection (c)(1) or any advanced electric or hybrid vehicle under subsection (c)(2), the Secretary of Energy shall determine (A) if the purchase or lease of the number of such vehicles specified in such subsection (c)(1) or (c)(2) will, with high probability, displace the normal level of private procurement of such vehicles which would conform to the applicable performance standards promulgated pursuant to subsection (b) and which would be used in the United States, and (B) if such displacement will occur, the necessary extent of such displacement in order to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Energy shall reduce the number of vehicles for which he shall contract for the purchase or lease under subsection (c)(1) or (c)(2) by the number determined under subsection (e)(1)(A) as modified by subsection (e)(1)(B), except in no event shall he contract for the purchase or lease pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of less than 1,000 electric or hybrid vehicles, and in no event shall he contract for the purchase or lease pursuant to subsection (c)(2) of less than 2,500 advanced electric or hybrid vehicles unless he determines on the basis of responses to the solicitations for proposals for such contracts, under the provisions of subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2) that lesser numbers of such vehicles which satisfy the applicable performance standards will be available within the delivery periods. All other provisions of subsection (c) shall apply.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the Congress to assist in the introduction into the Nation's transportation fleet of electric and hybrid vehicles and to assure that qualified small business concerns and other qualified borrowers are not excluded from participation in such development due to lack of adequate capital. Accordingly, it is the policy of the Congress to provide guarantees of loans made for such purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Encouragement of commercial production; purpose of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage the commercial production of electric and hybrid vehicles, the Secretary of Energy is authorized to guarantee, and to enter into commitments to guarantee, principal and interest on loans made by lenders to qualified borrowers, primarily small business concerns, for the purposes of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any guarantee under this section shall apply only to so much of the principal amount of the loan involved as does not exceed 90 percentum of the aggregate cost of the activity with respect to which the loan is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Terms and conditions of guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loan guarantees under this section shall be on such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Energy determines, except that a guarantee shall be made under this section only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the loan bears interest at a rate not to exceed such annual percent on the principal obligation outstanding as the Secretary of Energy determines to be reasonable, taking into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private sector for similar loans and risks by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the terms of such loan require full repayment over a period not to exceed 15 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the judgment of the Secretary of Energy, the amount of the loan (when combined with amounts available to the qualified borrower from other sources) will be sufficient to carry out the activity with respect to which the loan is made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the judgment of the Secretary of Energy, there is reasonable assurance of repayment of the loan by the qualified borrower; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) no loan shall be guaranteed by the Secretary of Energy under subsection (b) unless the Secretary of Energy finds that no other reasonable means of financing or refinancing is reasonably available to the applicant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount of the guarantee of any loan shall not exceed $3,000,000, unless the Secretary of Energy finds that a higher guarantee level for specific loan guarantees is necessary in order to carry out the purposes of this chapter. If the Secretary of Energy makes such finding, he shall immediately report that finding to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the Senate, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of <!-- PDFPage:1844 -->Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The aggregate amount of guarantees outstanding under this section at any one time shall not exceed $60,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) There is established in the Treasury of the United States an Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Development Fund (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the &quot;fund&quot;), which shall be available to the Secretary of Energy for carrying out the loan guarantee and principal and interest assistance program authorized by this chapter, including the payment of administrative expenses incurred in connection therewith. Moneys in the fund not needed for current operations may, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, be invested in bonds or other obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) There shall be paid into the fund such part of the amounts appropriated pursuant to section 2514 of this title as the Secretary of Energy deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter and such amounts as may be returned to the United States pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, and the amounts in the fund shall remain available until expended, except that after the expiration of the 7-year period established by subsection (h) of this section such amounts in the fund as are not required to secure outstanding guarantee obligations shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If at any time the moneys available in the fund are insufficient to enable the Secretary of Energy to discharge his responsibilities under this section, he shall issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. This borrowing authority shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are specified in appropriation Acts. Such authority shall be without fiscal year limitation. Redemption of such notes or obligations shall be made by the Secretary of Energy from appropriations or other moneys available under this chapter. Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, which shall not be less than a rate determined by taking into consideration the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of the notes or other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any notes or other obligations issued hereunder and for that purpose he is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include any purchase of such notes or obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired by him under this subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes or other obligations shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Business-type financial reports covering the operations of the fund shall be submitted to the Congress by the Secretary of Energy annually upon the completion of the appropriate accounting period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Qualified borrower</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &quot;qualified borrower&quot; means any partnership, corporation, or other legal entity which (as determined by the Secretary of Energy) has presented satisfactory evidence of an interest in electric or hybrid vehicle technology and is capable of performing research or completing the development and production of electric or hybrid vehicles or any components thereof in an acceptable manner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payment of principal and interest; default; recovery of losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to any loan guaranteed pursuant to this section, the Secretary of Energy is authorized to enter into a contract to pay, and to pay, the lender for and on behalf of the borrower the principal and interest charges which become due and payable on the unpaid balance of such loan if the Secretary of Energy finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the borrower is unable to meet principal and interest charges, that it is in the public interest to permit the borrower to continue to pursue the purposes of the project, and that the probable net cost to the Federal Government in paying such principal will be less than that which would result in the event of a default; and</p>
