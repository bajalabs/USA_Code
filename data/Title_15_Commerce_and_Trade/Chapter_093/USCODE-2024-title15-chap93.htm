<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) State regulation of the business of insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Act entitled &quot;An Act to express the intent of Congress with reference to the regulation of the business of insurance&quot; and approved March 9, 1945 (15 U.S.C. 1011 et seq.) (commonly referred to as the &quot;McCarran-Ferguson Act&quot;) remains the law of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Mandatory insurance licensing requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No person shall engage in the business of insurance in a State as principal or agent unless such person is licensed as required by the appropriate insurance regulator of such State in accordance with the relevant State insurance law, subject to subsections (c), (d), and (e).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Affiliations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), no State may, by statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action, prevent or restrict a depository institution, or an affiliate thereof, from being affiliated directly or indirectly or associated with any person, as authorized or permitted by this Act or any other provision of Federal law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to affiliations between depository institutions, or any affiliate thereof, and any insurer, paragraph (1) does not prohibit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any State from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) collecting, reviewing, and taking actions (including approval and disapproval) on applications and other documents or reports concerning any proposed acquisition of, or a change or continuation of control of, an insurer domiciled in that State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) exercising authority granted under applicable State law to collect information concerning any proposed acquisition of, or a change or continuation of control of, an insurer engaged in the business of insurance in, and regulated as an insurer by, such State;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em" style="padding-left:2em text-indent:0em">during the 60-day period preceding the effective date of the acquisition or change or continuation of control, so long as the collecting, reviewing, taking actions, or exercising authority by the State does not have the effect of discriminating, intentionally or unintentionally, against a depository institution or an affiliate thereof, or against any other person based upon an association of such person with a depository institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any State from requiring any person that is acquiring control of an insurer domiciled in that State to maintain or restore the capital requirements of that insurer to the level required under the capital regulations of general applicability in that State to avoid the requirement of preparing and filing with the insurance regulatory authority of that State a plan to increase the capital of the insurer, except that any determination by the State insurance regulatory authority with respect to such requirement shall be made not later than 60 days after the date of notification under subparagraph (A); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any State from restricting a change in the ownership of stock in an insurer, or a company formed for the purpose of controlling such insurer, after the conversion of the insurer from mutual to stock form so long as such restriction does not have the effect of discriminating, intentionally or unintentionally, against a depository institution or an affiliate thereof, or against any other person based upon an association of such person with a depository institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Activities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (3), and except with respect to insurance sales, solicitation, and cross marketing activities, which shall be governed by paragraph (2), no State may, by statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action, prevent or restrict a depository institution or an affiliate thereof from engaging directly or indirectly, either by itself or in conjunction with an affiliate, or any other person, in any activity authorized or permitted under this Act and the amendments made by this Act.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Insurance sales</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In accordance with the legal standards for preemption set forth in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Barnett Bank of Marion County N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25 (1996), no State may, by statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action, prevent or significantly interfere with the ability of a depository institu<!-- PDFPage:2262 -->tion, or an affiliate thereof, to engage, directly or indirectly, either by itself or in conjunction with an affiliate or any other person, in any insurance sales, solicitation, or crossmarketing activity.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain State laws preserved</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a State may impose any of the following restrictions, or restrictions that are substantially the same as but no more burdensome or restrictive than those in each of the following clauses:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Restrictions prohibiting the rejection of an insurance policy by a depository institution or an affiliate of a depository institution, solely because the policy has been issued or underwritten by any person who is not associated with such depository institution or affiliate when the insurance is required in connection with a loan or extension of credit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Restrictions prohibiting a requirement for any debtor, insurer, or insurance agent or broker to pay a separate charge in connection with the handling of insurance that is required in connection with a loan or other extension of credit or the provision of another traditional banking product by a depository institution, or any affiliate of a depository institution, unless such charge would be required when the depository institution or affiliate is the licensed insurance agent or broker providing the insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Restrictions prohibiting the use of any advertisement or other insurance promotional material by a depository institution or any affiliate of a depository institution that would cause a reasonable person to believe mistakenly that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the Federal Government or a State is responsible for the insurance sales activities of, or stands behind the credit of, the institution or affiliate; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) a State, or the Federal Government guarantees any returns on insurance products, or is a source of payment on any insurance obligation of or sold by the institution or affiliate;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Restrictions prohibiting the payment or receipt of any commission or brokerage fee or other valuable consideration for services as an insurance agent or broker to or by any person, unless such person holds a valid State license regarding the applicable class of insurance at the time at which the services are performed, except that, in this clause, the term &quot;services as an insurance agent or broker&quot; does not include a referral by an unlicensed person of a customer or potential customer to a licensed insurance agent or broker that does not include a discussion of specific insurance policy terms and conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) Restrictions prohibiting any compensation paid to or received by any individual who is not licensed to sell insurance, for the referral of a customer that seeks to purchase, or seeks an opinion or advice on, any insurance product to a person that sells or provides opinions or advice on such product, based on the purchase of insurance by the customer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) Restrictions prohibiting the release of the insurance information of a customer (defined as information concerning the premiums, terms, and conditions of insurance coverage, including expiration dates and rates, and insurance claims of a customer contained in the records of the depository institution or an affiliate thereof) to any person other than an officer, director, employee, agent, or affiliate of a depository institution, for the purpose of soliciting or selling insurance, without the express consent of the customer, other than a provision that prohibits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a transfer of insurance information to an unaffiliated insurer in connection with transferring insurance in force on existing insureds of the depository institution or an affiliate thereof, or in connection with a merger with or acquisition of an unaffiliated insurer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the release of information as otherwise authorized by State or Federal law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) Restrictions prohibiting the use of health information obtained from the insurance records of a customer for any purpose, other than for its activities as a licensed agent or broker, without the express consent of the customer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) Restrictions prohibiting the extension of credit or any product or service that is equivalent to an extension of credit, lease or sale of property of any kind, or furnishing of any services or fixing or varying the consideration for any of the foregoing, on the condition or requirement that the customer obtain insurance from a depository institution or an affiliate of a depository institution, or a particular insurer, agent, or broker, other than a prohibition that would prevent any such depository institution or affiliate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) from engaging in any activity described in this clause that would not violate section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 [12 U.S.C. 1971 et seq.], as interpreted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) from informing a customer or prospective customer that insurance is required in order to obtain a loan or credit, that loan or credit approval is contingent upon the procurement by the customer of acceptable insurance, or that insurance is available from the depository institution or an affiliate of the depository institution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ix) Restrictions requiring, when an application by a consumer for a loan or other extension of credit from a depository institution is pending, and insurance is offered or sold to the consumer or is required in connection with the loan or extension of credit by the depository institution or any affiliate thereof, that a written disclosure be provided to the consumer or prospective <!-- PDFPage:2263 -->customer indicating that the customer's choice of an insurance provider will not affect the credit decision or credit terms in any way, except that the depository institution may impose reasonable requirements concerning the creditworthiness of the insurer and scope of coverage chosen.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(x) Restrictions requiring clear and conspicuous disclosure, in writing, where practicable, to the customer prior to the sale of any insurance policy that such policy&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) is not a deposit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) is not guaranteed by any depository institution or, if appropriate, an affiliate of any such institution or any person soliciting the purchase of or selling insurance on the premises thereof; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) where appropriate, involves investment risk, including potential loss of principal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xi) Restrictions requiring that, when a customer obtains insurance (other than credit insurance or flood insurance) and credit from a depository institution, or any affiliate of such institution, or any person soliciting the purchase of or selling insurance on the premises thereof, the credit and insurance transactions be completed through separate documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xii) Restrictions prohibiting, when a customer obtains insurance (other than credit insurance or flood insurance) and credit from a depository institution or an affiliate of such institution, or any person soliciting the purchase of or selling insurance on the premises thereof, inclusion of the expense of insurance premiums in the primary credit transaction without the express written consent of the customer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(xiii) Restrictions requiring maintenance of separate and distinct books and records relating to insurance transactions, including all files relating to and reflecting consumer complaints, and requiring that such insurance books and records be made available to the appropriate State insurance regulator for inspection upon reasonable notice.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) OCC deference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Section 6714(e) of this title does not apply with respect to any State statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action regarding insurance sales, solicitation, or cross marketing activities described in subparagraph (A) that was issued, adopted, or enacted before September 3, 1998, and that is not described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Nondiscrimination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subsection (e) does not apply with respect to any State statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action regarding insurance sales, solicitation, or cross marketing activities described in subparagraph (A) that was issued, adopted, or enacted before September 3, 1998, and that is not described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) to limit the applicability of the decision of the Supreme Court in Barnett Bank of Marion County N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25 (1996) with respect to any State statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action that is not referred to or described in subparagraph (B); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to create any inference with respect to any State statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action that is not described in this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Insurance activities other than sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">State statutes, regulations, interpretations, orders, and other actions shall not be preempted under paragraph (1) to the extent that they&mdash;</p>

(commonly referred to as the &quot;McCarran-Ferguson Act&quot;);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) apply only to persons that are not depository institutions, but that are directly engaged in the business of insurance (except that they may apply to depository institutions engaged in providing savings bank life insurance as principal to the extent of regulating such insurance);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) are not prohibited under subsection (e).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Financial activities other than insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No State statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action shall be preempted under paragraph (1) to the extent that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it does not relate to, and is not issued and adopted, or enacted for the purpose of regulating, directly or indirectly, insurance sales, solicitations, or cross marketing activities covered under paragraph (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it does not relate to, and is not issued and adopted, or enacted for the purpose of regulating, directly or indirectly, the business of insurance activities other than sales, solicitations, or cross marketing activities, covered under paragraph (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) it does not relate to securities investigations or enforcement actions referred to in subsection (f); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) it&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) does not distinguish by its terms between depository institutions, and affiliates thereof, engaged in the activity at issue and other persons engaged in the same activity in a manner that is in any way adverse with respect to the conduct of the activity by any such depository institution or affiliate engaged in the activity at issue;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2264 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) as interpreted or applied, does not have, and will not have, an impact on depository institutions, or affiliates thereof, engaged in the activity at issue, or any person who has an association with any such depository institution or affiliate, that is substantially more adverse than its impact on other persons engaged in the same activity that are not depository institutions or affiliates thereof, or persons who do not have an association with any such depository institution or affiliate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) does not effectively prevent a depository institution or affiliate thereof from engaging in activities authorized or permitted by this Act or any other provision of Federal law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) does not conflict with the intent of this Act generally to permit affiliations that are authorized or permitted by Federal law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nondiscrimination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in any restrictions described in subsection (d)(2)(B), no State may, by statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action, regulate the insurance activities authorized or permitted under this Act or any other provision of Federal law of a depository institution, or affiliate thereof, to the extent that such statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) distinguishes by its terms between depository institutions, or affiliates thereof, and other persons engaged in such activities, in a manner that is in any way adverse to any such depository institution, or affiliate thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as interpreted or applied, has or will have an impact on depository institutions, or affiliates thereof, that is substantially more adverse than its impact on other persons providing the same products or services or engaged in the same activities that are not depository institutions, or affiliates thereof, or persons or entities affiliated therewith;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) effectively prevents a depository institution, or affiliate thereof, from engaging in insurance activities authorized or permitted by this Act or any other provision of Federal law; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) conflicts with the intent of this Act generally to permit affiliations that are authorized or permitted by Federal law between depository institutions, or affiliates thereof, and persons engaged in the business of insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsections (c) and (d) shall not be construed to affect&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the jurisdiction of the securities commission (or any agency or office performing like functions) of any State, under the laws of such State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to investigate and bring enforcement actions, consistent with section 77r(c) of this title, with respect to fraud or deceit or unlawful conduct by any person, in connection with securities or securities transactions; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) State laws, regulations, orders, interpretations, or other actions of general applicability relating to the governance of corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, or other business associations incorporated or formed under the laws of that State or domiciled in that State, or the applicability of the antitrust laws of any State or any State law that is similar to the antitrust laws if such laws, regulations, orders, interpretations, or other actions are not inconsistent with the purposes of this Act to authorize or permit certain affiliations and to remove barriers to such affiliations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Definitions</h4>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 101. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) the ability of businesses and individuals to obtain property and casualty insurance at reasonable and predictable prices, in order to spread the risk of both routine and catastrophic loss, is critical to economic growth, urban development, and the construction and maintenance of public and private housing, as well as to the promotion of United States exports and foreign trade in an increasingly interconnected world;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) property and casualty insurance firms are important financial institutions, the products of which allow mutualization of risk and the efficient use of financial resources and enhance the ability of the economy to maintain stability, while responding to a variety of economic, political, environmental, and other risks with a minimum of disruption;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) the ability of the insurance industry to cover the unprecedented financial risks presented by potential acts of terrorism in the United States can be a major factor in the recovery from terrorist attacks, while maintaining the stability of the economy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) widespread financial market uncertainties have arisen following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including the absence of information from which financial institutions can make statistically valid estimates of the probability and cost of future terrorist events, and therefore the size, funding, and allocation of the risk of loss caused by such acts of terrorism;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) a decision by property and casualty insurers to deal with such uncertainties, either by terminating property and casualty coverage for losses arising from terrorist events, or by radically escalating premium coverage to compensate for risks of loss that are not readily predictable, could seriously hamper ongoing and planned construction, property acquisition, and other business projects, generate a dramatic increase in rents, and otherwise suppress economic activity; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) the United States Government should provide temporary financial compensation to insured parties, contributing to the stabilization of the United States economy in a time of national crisis, while the financial services industry develops the systems, mechanisms, products, and programs necessary to create a viable financial services market for private terrorism risk insurance.</p>
<p class="note-body">&quot;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this title is to establish a temporary Federal program that provides for a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism, in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) protect consumers by addressing market disruptions and ensure the continued widespread avail<!-- PDFPage:2266 -->ability and affordability of property and casualty insurance for terrorism risk; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) allow for a transitional period for the private markets to stabilize, resume pricing of such insurance, and build capacity to absorb any future losses, while preserving State insurance regulation and consumer protections.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&quot;SEC. 102. DEFINITIONS.</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6716. Interagency consultation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the intention of the Congress that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as the umbrella supervisor for financial holding companies, and the State insurance regulators, as the functional regulators of companies engaged in insurance activities, coordinate efforts to supervise companies that control both a depository institution and a company engaged in insurance activities regulated under State law. In particular, Congress believes that the Board and the State insurance regulators should share, on a confidential basis, information relevant to the supervision of companies that control both a depository institution and a company engaged in insurance activities, including information regarding the financial health of the consolidated organization and information regarding transactions and relationships between insurance companies and affiliated depository institutions. The appropriate Federal banking agencies for depository institutions should also share, on a confidential basis, information with the relevant State insurance regulators regarding transactions and relationships between depository institutions and affiliated companies engaged in insurance activities. The purpose of this section is to encourage this coordination and confidential sharing of information, and to thereby improve both the efficiency and the quality of the supervision of financial holding companies and their affiliated depository institutions and companies engaged in insurance activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Examination results and other information</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Information of the Board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the request of the appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the Board may provide any information of the Board regarding the financial condition, risk management policies, and operations of any financial holding company that controls a company that is engaged in insurance activities and is regulated by such State insurance regulator, and regarding any transaction or relationship between such an insurance company and any affiliated depository institution. The Board may provide any other information to the appropriate State insurance regulator that the Board believes is necessary or appropriate to permit the State insurance regulator to administer and enforce applicable State insurance laws.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Banking agency information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the request of the appropriate insurance regulator of any State, the appropriate Federal banking agency may provide any information of the agency regarding any transaction or relationship between a depository institution supervised by such Federal banking agency and any affiliated company that is engaged in insurance activities regulated by such State insurance regulator. The appropriate Federal banking agency may provide any other information to the appropriate State insurance regulator that the agency believes is necessary or appropriate to permit the State insurance regulator to administer and enforce applicable State insurance laws.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) State insurance regulator information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the request of the Board or the appropriate Federal banking agency, a State insurance regulator may provide any examination or other reports, records, or other information to which such insurance regulator may have access with respect to a company which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is engaged in insurance activities and regulated by such insurance regulator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is an affiliate of a depository institution or financial holding company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before making any determination relating to the initial affiliation of, or the continuing affiliation of, a depository institution or financial holding company with a company engaged in insurance activities, the appropriate Federal banking agency shall consult with the appropriate State insurance regulator of such company and take the views of such insurance regulator into account in making such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect on other authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall limit in any respect the authority of the appropriate Federal banking agency with respect to a depository institution or bank holding company or any affiliate thereof under any provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Confidentiality and privilege</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Confidentiality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The appropriate Federal banking agency shall not provide any information or material that is entitled to confidential treatment under applicable Federal banking agency regulations, or other applicable law, to a State insurance regulator unless such regulator agrees to maintain the information or material in confidence and to take all reasonable steps to oppose any effort to secure disclosure of the information or material by the regulator. The appropriate Federal banking agency shall treat as confidential any information or material obtained from a State insurance regulator <!-- PDFPage:2276 -->that is entitled to confidential treatment under applicable State regulations, or other applicable law, and take all reasonable steps to oppose any effort to secure disclosure of the information or material by the Federal banking agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Privilege</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provision pursuant to this section of information or material by a Federal banking agency or State insurance regulator shall not constitute a waiver of, or otherwise affect, any privilege to which the information or material is otherwise subject.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Appropriate Federal banking agency; depository institution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The terms &quot;appropriate Federal banking agency&quot; and &quot;depository institution&quot; have the same meanings as in section 1813 of title 12.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Board and financial holding company</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6732. Redomestication of mutual insurers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Redomestication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A mutual insurer organized under the laws of any State may transfer its domicile to a transferee domicile as a step in a reorganization in which, pursuant to the laws of the transferee domicile and consistent with the standards in subsection (f), the mutual insurer becomes a stock insurer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of a mutual holding company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Resulting domicile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon complying with the applicable law of the transferee domicile governing transfers of domicile and completion of a transfer pursuant to this section, the mutual insurer shall cease to be a domestic insurer in the transferor domicile and, as a continuation of its corporate existence, shall be a domestic insurer of the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Licenses preserved</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The certificate of authority, agents&apos; appointments and licenses, rates, approvals and other items that a licensed State allows and that are in existence immediately prior to the date that a redomesticating insurer transfers its domicile pursuant to this subchapter shall continue in full force and effect upon transfer, if the insurer remains duly qualified to transact the business of insurance in such licensed State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effectiveness of outstanding policies and contracts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All outstanding insurance policies and annuities contracts of a redomesticating insurer shall remain in full force and effect and need not be endorsed as to the new domicile of the insurer, unless so ordered by the State insurance regulator of a licensed State, and then only in the case of outstanding policies and contracts whose owners reside in such licensed State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Applicable State law may require a redomesticating insurer to file new policy forms with the State insurance regulator of a licensed State on or before the effective date of the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a redomesticating insurer may use existing policy forms with appropriate endorsements to reflect the new domicile of the redomesticating insurer until the new policy forms are approved for use by the State insurance regulator of such licensed State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A redomesticating insurer shall give notice of the proposed transfer to the State insurance regulator of each licensed State and shall file <!-- PDFPage:2277 -->promptly any resulting amendments to corporate documents required to be filed by a foreign licensed mutual insurer with the insurance regulator of each such licensed State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Procedural requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No mutual insurer may redomesticate to another State and reorganize into a mutual holding company pursuant to this section unless the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile determines that the plan of reorganization of the insurer includes the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Approval by board of directors and policyholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The reorganization is approved by at least a majority of the board of directors of the mutual insurer and at least a majority of the policyholders who vote after notice, disclosure of the reorganization and the effects of the transaction on policyholder contractual rights, and reasonable opportunity to vote, in accordance with such notice, disclosure, and voting procedures as are approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Continued voting control by policyholders; review of public stock offering</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the consummation of a reorganization, the policyholders of the reorganized insurer shall have the same voting rights with respect to the mutual holding company as they had before the reorganization with respect to the mutual insurer. With respect to an initial public offering of stock, the offering shall be conducted in compliance with applicable securities laws and in a manner approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Award of stock or grant of options to officers and directors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the applicable period provided for under the State law of the transferee domicile following completion of an initial public offering, or for a period of six months if no such applicable period is provided, neither a stock holding company nor the converted insurer shall award any stock options or stock grants to persons who are elected officers or directors of the mutual holding company, the stock holding company, or the converted insurer, except with respect to any such awards or options to which a person is entitled as a policyholder and as approved by the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Policyholder rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon reorganization into a mutual holding company, the contractual rights of the policyholders are preserved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Fair and equitable treatment of policyholders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The reorganization is approved as fair and equitable to the policyholders by the insurance regulator of the transferee domicile.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any law that has the purpose or effect of impeding the activities of, taking any action against, or applying any provision of law or regulation to, any insurer or an affiliate of such insurer because that insurer or any affiliate plans to redomesticate, or has redomesticated, pursuant to this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any law that has the purpose or effect of impeding the activities of, taking action against, or applying any provision of law or regulation to, any insured or any insurance licensee or other intermediary because such person has procured insurance from or placed insurance with any insurer or affiliate of such insurer that plans to redomesticate, or has redomesticated, pursuant to this subchapter, but only to the extent that such law would treat such insured licensee or other intermediary differently than if the person procured insurance from, or placed insurance with, an insured licensee or other intermediary which had not redomesticated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any law that has the purpose or effect of terminating, because of the redomestication of a mutual insurer pursuant to this subchapter, any certificate of authority, agent appointment or license, rate approval, or other approval, of any State insurance regulator or other State authority in existence immediately prior to the redomestication in any State other than the transferee domicile.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Differential treatment prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State law, regulation, interpretation, or functional equivalent thereof, of a State other than a transferee domicile may treat a redomesticating or redomesticated insurer or any affiliate thereof any differently than an insurer operating in that State that is not a redomesticating or redomesticated insurer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Laws prohibiting operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any licensed State fails to issue, delays the issuance of, or seeks to revoke an original or renewal certificate of authority of a redomesticated insurer promptly following redomestication, except on grounds and in a manner consistent with its past practices regarding the issuance of certificates of authority to foreign insurers that are not redomesticating, then the redomesticating insurer shall be exempt from any State law of the licensed State to the extent that such State law or the operation of such State law would make unlawful, or regulate, directly or indirectly, the operation of the redomesticated insurer, except that such licensed State may require the redomesticated insurer to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) comply with the unfair claim settlement practices law of the licensed State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) pay, on a nondiscriminatory basis, applicable premium and other taxes which are levied on licensed insurers or policyholders under the laws of the licensed State;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2278 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) register with and designate the State insurance regulator as its agent solely for the purpose of receiving service of legal documents or process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) submit to an examination by the State insurance regulator in any licensed State in which the redomesticated insurer is doing business to determine the insurer's financial condition, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the State insurance regulator of the transferee domicile has not begun an examination of the redomesticated insurer and has not scheduled such an examination to begin before the end of the 1-year period beginning on the date of the redomestication; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any such examination is coordinated to avoid unjustified duplication and repetition;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) comply with a lawful order issued in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a delinquency proceeding commenced by the State insurance regulator of any licensed State if there has been a judicial finding of financial impairment under paragraph (7); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a voluntary dissolution proceeding;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) comply with any State law regarding deceptive, false, or fraudulent acts or practices, except that if the licensed State seeks an injunction regarding the conduct described in this paragraph, such injunction must be obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction as provided in section 6734(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) comply with an injunction issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a petition by the State insurance regulator alleging that the redomesticating insurer is in hazardous financial condition or is financially impaired;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) participate in any insurance insolvency guaranty association on the same basis as any other insurer licensed in the licensed State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) require a person acting, or offering to act, as an insurance licensee for a redomesticated insurer in the licensed State to obtain a license from that State, except that such State may not impose any qualification or requirement that discriminates against a nonresident insurance licensee.</p>
