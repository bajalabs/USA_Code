<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Reducing counterfeit and infringing goods in the domestic and international supply chain.</p>

Such recommendations may include recommendations on how to reduce duplication in personnel, materials, technologies, and facilities utilized by the agencies and Departments responsible for the enforcement, investigation, or prosecution of intellectual property crimes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Ensuring that information is identified and shared among the relevant departments and agencies, to the extent permitted by law, including requirements relating to confidentiality and privacy, and to the extent that such sharing of information is consistent with Department of Justice and other law enforcement protocols for handling such information, to aid in the objective of arresting and prosecuting individuals and entities that are knowingly involved in the financing, production, trafficking, or sale of counterfeit or infringing goods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Disrupting and eliminating domestic and international counterfeiting and infringement networks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Strengthening the capacity of other countries to protect and enforce intellectual property rights, and reducing the number of countries that fail to enforce laws preventing the financing, production, trafficking, and sale of counterfeit and infringing goods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Working with other countries to establish international standards and policies for the effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Protecting intellectual property rights overseas by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) ensuring that the information referred to in subparagraph (A) is provided to appropriate United States law enforcement agencies in order to assist, as warranted, enforcement activities in cooperation with appropriate law enforcement agencies in other countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) building a formal process for consulting with companies, industry associations, labor unions, and other interested groups in other countries with respect to intellectual property enforcement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Timing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 12 months after October 13, 2008, and not later than December 31 of every third year thereafter, the IPEC shall submit the joint strategic plan to the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, and to the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Responsibility of the IPEC</h4>
