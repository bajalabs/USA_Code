<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7701. Congressional findings and policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Electronic mail has become an extremely important and popular means of communication, relied on by millions of Americans on a daily basis for personal and commercial purposes. Its low cost and global reach make it extremely convenient and efficient, and offer unique opportunities for the development and growth of frictionless commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The convenience and efficiency of electronic mail are threatened by the extremely rapid growth in the volume of unsolicited commercial electronic mail. Unsolicited commercial electronic mail is currently estimated to account for over half of all electronic mail traffic, up from an estimated 7 percent in 2001, and the volume continues to rise. Most of these messages are fraudulent or deceptive in one or more respects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The receipt of unsolicited commercial electronic mail may result in costs to recipients who cannot refuse to accept such mail and who incur costs for the storage of such mail, or for the time spent accessing, reviewing, and discarding such mail, or for both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The receipt of a large number of unwanted messages also decreases the convenience of electronic mail and creates a risk that wanted electronic mail messages, both commercial and noncommercial, will be lost, overlooked, or discarded amidst the larger volume of unwanted messages, thus reducing the reliability and usefulness of electronic mail to the recipient.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Some commercial electronic mail contains material that many recipients may consider vulgar or pornographic in nature.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The growth in unsolicited commercial electronic mail imposes significant monetary costs on providers of Internet access services, businesses, and educational and nonprofit institutions that carry and receive such mail, as there is a finite volume of mail that such providers, businesses, and institutions can handle without further investment in infrastructure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail purposefully disguise the source of such mail.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Many senders of unsolicited commercial electronic mail purposefully include misleading information in the messages&apos; subject lines in order to induce the recipients to view the messages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) While some senders of commercial electronic mail messages provide simple and reliable ways for recipients to reject (or &quot;opt-out&quot; of) receipt of commercial electronic mail from such senders in the future, other senders provide no such &quot;opt-out&quot; mechanism, or refuse to honor the requests of recipients not to receive electronic mail from such senders in the future, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Many senders of bulk unsolicited commercial electronic mail use computer programs to gather large numbers of electronic mail addresses on an automated basis from Internet websites or online services where users must post their addresses in order to make full use of the website or service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Many States have enacted legislation intended to regulate or reduce unsolicited commercial electronic mail, but these statutes impose different standards and requirements. As a result, they do not appear to have been successful in addressing the problems associated with unsolicited commercial electronic mail, in part because, since an electronic mail address does not specify a geographic location, it can be extremely difficult for law-abiding businesses to know with which of these disparate statutes they are required to comply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) The problems associated with the rapid growth and abuse of unsolicited commercial electronic mail cannot be solved by Federal legislation alone. The development and adoption of technological approaches and the pursuit of cooperative efforts with other countries will be necessary as well.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2379 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Congressional determination of public policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On the basis of the findings in subsection (a), the Congress determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is a substantial government interest in regulation of commercial electronic mail on a nationwide basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) senders of commercial electronic mail should not mislead recipients as to the source or content of such mail; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) recipients of commercial electronic mail have a right to decline to receive additional commercial electronic mail from the same source.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a &quot;from&quot; line (the line identifying or purporting to identify a person initiating the message) that accurately identifies any person who initiated the message shall not be considered materially false or materially misleading; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) header information shall be considered materially misleading if it fails to identify accurately a protected computer used to initiate the message because the person initiating the message knowingly uses another protected computer to relay or retransmit the message for purposes of disguising its origin.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibition of deceptive subject headings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission to a protected computer of a commercial electronic mail message if such person has actual knowledge, or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances, that a subject heading of the message would be likely to mislead a recipient, acting reasonably under the circumstances, about a material fact regarding the contents or subject matter of the message (consistent with the criteria used in enforcement of section 45 of this title).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Inclusion of return address or comparable mechanism in commercial electronic mail</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) remains capable of receiving such messages or communications for no less than 30 days after the transmission of the original message.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) More detailed options possible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The person initiating a commercial electronic mail message may comply with subparagraph (A)(i) by providing the recipient a list or menu from which the recipient may choose the specific types of commercial electronic mail messages the recipient wants to receive or does not want to receive from the sender, if the list or menu includes an option under which the recipient may choose not to receive any commercial electronic mail messages from the sender.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Temporary inability to receive messages or process requests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A return electronic mail address or other mechanism does not fail to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (A) if it is unexpectedly and temporarily unable to receive messages or process requests due to a technical problem beyond the control of the sender if the problem is corrected within a reasonable time period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Prohibition of transmission of commercial electronic mail after objection</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a recipient makes a request using a mechanism provided pursuant to paragraph (3) not to receive some or any commercial electronic mail messages from such sender, then it is unlawful&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for any person acting on behalf of the sender to initiate the transmission to the recipient, more than 10 business days after the receipt of such request, of a commercial electronic mail message with actual knowledge, or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances, that such message falls within the scope of the request;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for any person acting on behalf of the sender to assist in initiating the transmission to the recipient, through the provision or selection of addresses to which the message will be sent, of a commercial electronic mail message with actual knowledge, or knowledge fairly implied on the basis of objective circumstances, that such message would violate clause (i) or (ii); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) for the sender, or any other person who knows that the recipient has made such a request, to sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise transfer or release the electronic mail address of the recipient (including through any transaction or other transfer involving mailing lists bearing the electronic mail address of the recipient) for any purpose other than compliance with this chapter or other provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Subsequent affirmative consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A prohibition in subparagraph (A) does not apply if there is affirmative consent by the recipient subsequent to the request under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Inclusion of identifier, opt-out, and physical address in commercial electronic mail</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) It is unlawful for any person to initiate the transmission of any commercial electronic mail message to a protected computer unless the message provides&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &quot;materially&quot;, when used with respect to false or misleading header information, includes the alteration or concealment of header information in a manner that would impair the ability of an Internet access service processing the message on behalf of a recipient, a person alleging a violation of this section, or a law enforcement agency to identify, locate, or respond to a person who initiated the electronic mail message or to investigate the alleged violation, or the ability of a recipient of the message to respond to a person who initiated the electronic message.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No person may initiate in or affecting interstate commerce the transmission, to a protected computer, of any commercial electronic mail message that includes sexually oriented material and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) fail to include in subject heading for the electronic mail message the marks or notices prescribed by the Commission under this subsection; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) fail to provide that the matter in the message that is initially viewable to the recipient, when the message is opened by any recipient and absent any further actions by the recipient, includes only&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to the extent required or authorized pursuant to paragraph (2), any such marks or notices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the information required to be included in the message pursuant to subsection (a)(5); and</p>
