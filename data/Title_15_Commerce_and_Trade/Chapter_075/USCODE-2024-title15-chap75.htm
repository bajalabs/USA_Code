<p class="note-body">This chapter, referred to in text, was in the original &quot;this subtitle&quot;, meaning subtitle E (&sect;&sect;5401 to 5413, 5421 to 5423) of title V of Pub. L. 100&ndash;418 which, in addition to enacting this chapter, enacted section 4603a of this title and section 194b of Title 2, The Congress. For complete classification of subtitle E to the Code, see Tables.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 4906 of this title, referred to in par. (4), was in the original &quot;section 3816&quot;, meaning section 3816 of Pub. L. 100&ndash;418, and was translated as if it read section 5406 of Pub. L. 100&ndash;418, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 3816 was the provision which established the Data Bank in a predecessor version of H.R. 4848 (which became Pub. L. 100&ndash;418), Pub. L. 100&ndash;418 does not contain a section 3816, and section 5406 of Pub. L. 100&ndash;418 is the provision establishing the Data Bank.</p>
