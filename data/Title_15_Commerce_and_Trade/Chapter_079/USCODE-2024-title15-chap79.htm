<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) metal casting is an important process for manufacturing many items imported into or exported from the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the encouragement and maintenance of a technically advanced United States metal casting industry is essential to the competitiveness of many American industries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) maintaining a viable metal casting industry is vital to the national security and economic well being of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the promotion of technology competitiveness and energy efficiency in the United States metal casting industry by the Federal Government is necessary to maintain a viable metal casting industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) many metal casting companies lack the resources to conduct metal casting research alone, placing them at a serious competitive disadvantage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the support of university-based research in metal casting is important in promoting technology development and providing industry with qualified engineers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) by combining the resources of the Federal Government, universities, industry, and private organizations, to conduct research and development activities, substantial technological benefits will result to the metal casting industry.</p>
