<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the United States fastener industry is a significant contributor to the global economy, employing thousands of workers in hundreds of communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the American economy uses billions of fasteners each year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) state-of-the-art manufacturing and improved quality assurance systems have dramatically improved fastener quality, so virtually all fasteners sold in commerce meet or exceed the consensus standards for the uses to which they are applied;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a small number of mismarked, misrepresented, and counterfeit fasteners do enter commerce in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) multiple criteria for the identification of fasteners exist, including grade identification markings and manufacturer's insignia, to enable purchasers and users of fasteners to accurately evaluate the characteristics of individual fasteners.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of the penalty shall be assessed by the Secretary by written notice. In determining the amount of the penalty, the Secretary shall consider the nature, circumstances, and gravity of the violation and, with respect to the person found to have committed the violation, the degree of culpability, any history of prior violations, the effect on ability to continue to do business, any good faith attempt to achieve compliance, ability to pay the penalty, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under paragraph (2) of this subsection may obtain review thereof in the appropriate court of the United States by filing a notice of appeal in such court within 30 days from the date of such order and by simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by certified mail to the Secretary. The findings and order of the Secretary shall be set aside by such court if they are found to be unsupported by substantial evidence, as provided in section 706(2) of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may arbitrate, compromise, modify, or remit, with or without conditions, any civil penalty which is subject to imposition or which has been imposed under this section prior to referral to the Attorney General under paragraph (5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A civil penalty assessed under this subsection may be recovered in an action brought <!-- PDFPage:2194 -->by the Attorney General on behalf of the United States in the appropriate district court of the United States.

<p class="statutory-body">(6) For the purpose of conducting any hearing under this section, the Secretary may issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books, and documents, and may administer oaths. Witnesses summoned shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of contempt or refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any person pursuant to this paragraph, the district court of the United States for any district in which such person is found, resides, or transacts business, upon application by the United States and after notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony before the Secretary or to appear and produce documents before the Secretary, or both, and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Criminal penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whoever knowingly certifies, marks, offers for sale, or sells a fastener in violation of this chapter or a regulation under this chapter shall be fined under title 18, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.</p>
