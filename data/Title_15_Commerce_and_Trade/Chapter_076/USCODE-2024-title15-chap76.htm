Such plug shall be recessed no more than 6 millimeters from the muzzle end of the barrel of such firearm.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Consumer Product Safety Commission may provide for an alternate marking or device for any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm not capable of being marked as provided in paragraph (1) and may waive the requirement of any such marking or device for any toy, look-alike, or imitation firearm that will only be used in the theatrical, movie or television industry.</p>
