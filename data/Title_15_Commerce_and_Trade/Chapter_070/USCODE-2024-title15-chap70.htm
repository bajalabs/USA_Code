<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The label statements required by paragraph (1) shall be introduced by each tobacco product manufacturer, packager, importer, distributor, or retailer of smokeless tobacco products concurrently into the distribution chain of such products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The provisions of this subsection do not apply to a tobacco product manufacturer or distributor of any smokeless tobacco product that does not manufacture, package, or import smokeless tobacco products for sale or distribution within the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The word &quot;WARNING&quot; shall appear in capital letters, and each label statement shall appear in conspicuous and legible type.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The label statements specified in subsection (a)(1) shall be randomly displayed in each 12-month period, in as equal a number of times as is possible on each brand of the product and be randomly distributed in all areas of the United States in which the product is marketed in accordance with a plan submitted by the tobacco product manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer and approved by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The label statements specified in subsection (a)(1) shall be rotated quarterly in alternating sequence in advertisements for each brand of smokeless tobacco product in accordance with a plan submitted by the tobacco product manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer to, and approved by, the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall review each plan submitted under subparagraphs (A) and (B) and approve it if the plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) will provide for the equal distribution and display on packaging and the rotation required in advertising under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) assures that all of the labels required under this section will be displayed by the tobacco product manufacturer, importer, distributor, or retailer at the same time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) This paragraph applies to a retailer only if that retailer is responsible for or directs the label statements under this section, unless the retailer displays, in a location open to the public, an advertisement that does not contain a warning label or has been altered by the retailer in a way that is material to the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may, through a rulemaking under section 553 of title 5, adjust the format and type sizes for the label statements required by this section; the text, format, and type sizes of any required tar, nicotine yield, or other constituent disclosures; or the text, format, and type sizes for any other disclosures required under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.]. The text of any such label statements or disclosures shall be required to appear only within the 20 percent area of advertisements provided by paragraph (2).
