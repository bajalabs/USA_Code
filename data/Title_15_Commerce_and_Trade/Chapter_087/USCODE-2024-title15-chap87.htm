<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Telemarketing differs from other sales activities in that it can be carried out by sellers across State lines without direct contact with the consumer. Telemarketers also can be very mobile, easily moving from State to State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Interstate telemarketing fraud has become a problem of such magnitude that the resources of the Federal Trade Commission are not sufficient to ensure adequate consumer protection from such fraud.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Consumers and others are estimated to lose $40 billion a year in telemarketing fraud.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Consumers are victimized by other forms of telemarketing deception and abuse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Consequently, Congress should enact legislation that will offer consumers necessary protection from telemarketing deception and abuse.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;534, &sect;2, Nov. 22, 2000, 114 Stat. 2555, provided that: &quot;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(1) Older Americans are among the most rapidly growing segments of our society.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(2) Our Nation's elderly are too frequently the victims of violent crime, property crime, and consumer and telemarketing fraud.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(3) The elderly are often targeted and retargeted in a range of fraudulent schemes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(4) The TRIAD program, originally sponsored by the National Sheriffs&apos; Association, International Association of Chiefs of Police, and the American Association of Retired Persons unites sheriffs, police chiefs, senior volunteers, elder care providers, families, and seniors to reduce the criminal victimization of the elderly.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(5) Congress should continue to support TRIAD and similar community partnerships that improve the safety and quality of life for millions of senior citizens.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(6) There are few other community-based efforts that forge partnerships to coordinate criminal justice and social service resources to improve the safety and security of the elderly.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(7) According to the National Consumers League, telemarketing fraud costs consumers nearly $40,000,000,000 each year.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(8) Senior citizens are often the target of telemarketing fraud.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(9) Fraudulent telemarketers compile the names of consumers who are potentially vulnerable to telemarketing fraud into the so-called &apos;mooch lists&apos;.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2220 --><p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(10) It is estimated that 56 percent of the names on such &apos;mooch lists&apos; are individuals age 50 or older.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(11) The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Trade Commission have provided resources to assist private-sector organizations to operate outreach programs to warn senior citizens whose names appear on confiscated &apos;mooch lists&apos;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(12) The Administration on Aging was formed, in part, to provide senior citizens with the resources, information, and assistance their special circumstances require.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(13) The Administration on Aging has a system in place to inform senior citizens of the dangers of telemarketing fraud.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&quot;(14) Senior citizens need to be warned of the dangers of telemarketing fraud before they become victims of such fraud.&quot;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Senior Fraud Prevention Program</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever an attorney general of any State has reason to believe that the interests of the residents of that State have been or are being threatened or adversely affected because any person has engaged or is engaging in a pattern or practice of telemarketing which violates any rule of the Commission under section 6102 of this title, the State, as parens patriae, may bring a civil action on behalf of its residents in an appropriate district court of the United States to enjoin such telemarketing, to enforce compliance with such rule of the Commission, to obtain damages, restitution, or other compensation on behalf of residents of such State, or to obtain such further and other relief as the court may deem appropriate.</p>
