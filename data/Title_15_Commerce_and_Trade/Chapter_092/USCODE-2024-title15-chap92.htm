<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6601. Findings and purposes</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) Many information technology systems, devices, and programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 and after December 31, 1999, and will read dates in the year 2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 or thereafter or will fail to process dates after December 31, 1999.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and defense systems, in the United States and throughout the world.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) It is in the national interest that producers and users of technology products concentrate their attention and resources in the time remaining before January 1, 2000, on assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions associated with computer failures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have a range of undesirable effects, including the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) It would threaten to waste technical and financial resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems remain or become operational.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) It could threaten the network of valued and trusted business and customer relationships that are important to the effective functioning of the national economy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) It would strain the Nation's legal system, causing particular problems for the small businesses and individuals who already find that system inaccessible because of its complexity and expense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the difficulties associated with the date change and work against the successful resolution of those difficulties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation to assure that the year 2000 problems described in this section do not unnecessarily disrupt interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially devastating economic impact of such problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Resorting to the legal system for resolution of year 2000 problems described in this section is not feasible for many businesses and individuals who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly small businesses and individuals who already find the legal system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Concern about the potential for liability&mdash;in particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense associated with defending against even the most insubstantial lawsuits&mdash;is prompting many persons and businesses with technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year 2000 computer date-change problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A proliferation of frivolous lawsuits relating to year 2000 computer date-change problems by opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by straining the resources of the legal system and depriving deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Congress encourages businesses to approach their disputes relating to year 2000 computer date-change problems responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-consuming, and costly litigation about Y2K failures, particularly those that are not material. Congress supports good faith negotiations between parties when there is such a dispute, and, if necessary, urges the parties to enter into voluntary, nonbinding mediation rather than litigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Based upon the power of the Congress under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States, the purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to establish uniform legal standards that give all businesses and users of technology products reasonable incentives to solve year 2000 computer date-change problems before they develop;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage continued remediation and testing efforts to solve such problems by providers, suppliers, customers, and other contracting partners;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to encourage private and public parties alike to resolve disputes relating to year 2000 computer date-change problems by alternative dispute mechanisms in order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to encourage the prompt identification and correction of such problems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real injury to obtain complete relief.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Preemption of State law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This chapter supersedes State law to the extent that it establishes a rule of law applicable <!-- PDFPage:2252 -->to a Y2K action that is inconsistent with State law, but nothing in this chapter implicates, alters, or diminishes the ability of a State to defend itself against any claim on the basis of sovereign immunity.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No person who transacts business on matters directly or indirectly affecting residential mortgages shall cause or permit a foreclosure on any such mortgage against a consumer as a result of an actual Y2K failure that results in an inability to accurately or timely process any mortgage payment transaction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A consumer who is affected by an inability described in paragraph (1) shall notify the servicer for the mortgage, in writing and within 7 business days from the time that the consumer becomes aware of the Y2K failure and the consumer's inability to accurately or timely fulfill his or her obligation to pay, of such failure and inability and shall provide to the servicer any available documentation with respect to the failure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Actions may resume after grace period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an action prohibited under paragraph (1) may be resumed, if the consumer's mortgage obligation has not been paid and the servicer of the mortgage has not expressly and in writing granted the consumer an extension of time during which to pay the consumer's mortgage obligation, but only after the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) four weeks after January 1, 2000; or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except in a Y2K action that is a contract action, and except as provided in subsections (b) through (g), a person against whom a final judgment is entered in a Y2K action shall be liable solely for the portion of the judgment that corresponds to the relative and proportionate responsibility of that person. In determining the percentage of responsibility of any defendant, the trier of fact shall determine that percentage as a percentage of the total fault of all persons, including the plaintiff, who caused or contributed to the total loss incurred by the plaintiff.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proportionate liability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination of responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any Y2K action that is not a contract action, the court shall instruct the jury to answer special interrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the court shall make findings with respect to each defendant, including defendants who have entered into settlements with the plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the percentage of responsibility, if any, of each defendant, measured as a percentage of the total fault of all persons who caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if alleged by the plaintiff, whether the defendant (other than a defendant who has entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiff)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) knowingly committed fraud.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents of special interrogatories or findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The responses to interrogatories or findings under paragraph (1) shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility of each defendant found to have caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Factors for consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the percentage of responsibility under this subsection, the trier of fact shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the nature of the conduct of each person found to have caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the nature and extent of the causal relationship between the conduct of each such person and the damages incurred by the plaintiff.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Joint liability for specific intent or fraud</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (a), the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action that is not a contract action is joint and several if the trier of fact specifically determines that the defendant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) knowingly committed fraud.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fraud; recklessness</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Knowing commission of fraud described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, a defendant knowingly committed fraud if the defendant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) made an untrue statement of a material fact, with actual knowledge that the statement was false;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) omitted a fact necessary to make the statement not be misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the omission, the statement was false; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) knew that the plaintiff was reasonably likely to rely on the false statement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Recklessness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subsection (b)(1)(B) and paragraph (1) of this subsection, reckless conduct by the defendant does not constitute either a specific intent to injure, or the knowing commission of fraud, by the defendant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Right to contribution not affected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section affects the right, under any other law, of a defendant to contribution with respect to another defendant found under subsection (b)(1)(B), or determined under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, to have acted with specific intent to injure the plaintiff or to have knowingly committed fraud.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Uncollectible share</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subsection (a), if, upon motion made not later than 6 months after a final judgment is entered in any Y2K action that is not a contract action, the court determines that all or part of the share of the judgment against a defendant for compensatory damages is not collectible against that defendant, then each other defendant in the action is liable for the uncollectible share as follows:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2255 --><h4 class="clause-head">(i) Percentage of net worth</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The other defendants are jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if the plaintiff establishes that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable damages under the final judgment are equal to more than 10 percent of the net worth of the plaintiff; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the net worth of the plaintiff is less than $200,000.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Other plaintiffs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For a plaintiff not described in clause (i), each of the other defendants is liable for the uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of responsibility of that defendant.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Additional liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For a plaintiff not described in clause (i), in addition to the share identified in clause (ii), the defendant is liable for an additional portion of the uncollectible share in an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount determined under clause (ii) if the plaintiff demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant acted with reckless disregard for the likelihood that its acts would cause injury of the sort suffered by the plaintiff.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Overall limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The total payments required under subparagraph (A) from all defendants may not exceed the amount of the uncollectible share.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Subject to contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A defendant against whom judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Suits by consumers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the other defendants are jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the plaintiff is a consumer whose suit alleges or arises out of a defect in a consumer product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the plaintiff is suing as an individual and not as part of a class action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) In this subparagraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) The term &quot;class action&quot; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) a single lawsuit in which: (1) damages are sought on behalf of more than 10 persons or prospective class members; or (2) one or more named parties seek to recover damages on a representative basis on behalf of themselves and other unnamed parties similarly situated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) any group of lawsuits filed in or pending in the same court in which: (1) damages are sought on behalf of more than 10 persons; and (2) the lawsuits are joined, consolidated, or otherwise proceed as a single action for any purpose.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) The term &quot;consumer&quot; means an individual who acquires a consumer product for purposes other than resale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) The term &quot;consumer product&quot; means any personal property or service which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special right of contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that a defendant is required to make an additional payment under paragraph (1), that defendant may recover contribution&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) from the defendant originally liable to make the payment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) from any other defendant that is jointly and severally liable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) from any other defendant held proportionately liable who is liable to make the same payment and has paid less than that other defendant's proportionate share of that payment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) from any other person responsible for the conduct giving rise to the payment that would have been liable to make the same payment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Nondisclosure to jury</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The standard for allocation of damages under subsection (a) and subsection (b)(1), and the procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to members of the jury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Settlement discharge</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A defendant who settles a Y2K action that is not a contract action at any time before final verdict or judgment shall be discharged from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. Upon entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall enter an order constituting the final discharge of all obligations to the plaintiff of the settling defendant arising out of the action. The order shall bar all future claims for contribution arising out of the action&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by any person against the settling defendant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by the settling defendant against any person other than a person whose liability has been extinguished by the settlement of the settling defendant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a defendant enters into a settlement with the plaintiff before the final verdict or judgment, the verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an amount that corresponds to the percentage of responsibility of that defendant; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount paid to the plaintiff by that defendant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) General right of contribution</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A defendant who is jointly and severally liable for damages in any Y2K action that is not a contract action may recover contribution from any other person who, if joined in the original action, would have been liable for the same damages. A claim for contribution shall be determined based on the percentage of responsibility of the claimant and of each person against whom a claim for contribution is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Statute of limitations for contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An action for contribution in connection with a Y2K action that is not a contract ac<!-- PDFPage:2256 -->tion shall be brought not later than 6 months after the entry of a final, nonappealable judgment in the Y2K action, except that an action for contribution brought by a defendant who was required to make an additional payment under subsection (d)(1) may be brought not later than 6 months after the date on which such payment was made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) More protective State law not preempted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section preempts or supersedes any provision of State law that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) limits the liability of a defendant in a Y2K action to a lesser amount than the amount determined under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) otherwise affords a greater degree of protection from joint or several liability than is afforded by this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Person to whom notice to be sent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The notice required by subsection (a) shall be sent&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the registered agent of the prospective defendant for service of legal process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the prospective defendant does not have a registered agent, then to the chief executive officer if the prospective defendant is a corporation, to the managing partner if the prospective defendant is a partnership, to the proprietor if the prospective defendant is a sole proprietorship, or to a similarly-situated person if the prospective defendant is any other enterprise; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the prospective defendant has designated a person to receive prelitigation notices on a Year 2000 Internet Website (as defined in section 3(7) of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act), to the designated person, if the prospective plaintiff has reasonable access to the Internet.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Presumptive time of receipt</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a notice under subsection (a) is presumed to be received 7 days after it was sent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If a prospective defendant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) fails to respond to a notice provided pursuant to subsection (a) within the 30 days specified in subsection (c)(1); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) does not describe the action, if any, the prospective defendant has taken, or will take, to address the problem identified by the prospective plaintiff,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the prospective plaintiff may immediately commence a legal action against that prospective defendant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Remediation period</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the prospective defendant responds and proposes remedial action it will take, or offers to engage in alternative dispute resolution, then the prospective plaintiff shall allow the prospective defendant an additional 60 days from the end of the 30-day notice period to complete the proposed remedial action or alternative dispute resolution before commencing a legal action against that prospective defendant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Extension by agreement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">If a defendant determines that a plaintiff has filed a Y2K action without providing the notice specified in subsection (a) or without awaiting the expiration of the appropriate waiting period specified in subsection (c), the defendant may treat the plaintiff's complaint as such a notice by so informing the court and the plaintiff in its initial response to the plaintiff. If any defendant elects to treat the complaint as such a notice&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the court shall stay all discovery and all other proceedings in the action for the appropriate period after filing of the complaint; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the time for filing answers and all other pleadings shall be tolled during the appropriate period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Effect of contractual or statutory waiting periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before January 1, 1999, requires notice of nonperformance and provides for a period of delay prior to the initiation of suit for breach or repudiation of contract, the period of delay provided by contract or the statute is controlling over the waiting period specified in subsections (c) and (d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) State law controls alternative methods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section supersedes or otherwise preempts any State law or rule of civil procedure with respect to the use of alternative dispute resolution for Y2K actions.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Substantial privity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff is a person who, prior to the defendant's performance of such services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the services were being performed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain claims excluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), claims in which the defendant's actual or constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim under applicable law do not include claims for negligence but do include claims such as fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract or economic advantage.</p>
